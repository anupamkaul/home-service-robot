Instructions for Installing and Running the rqt_multiplot ROS plugin:

GitHub documentation:
Access this link and go through the rqt_multiplot ROS plugin documentation:

https://github.com/ANYbotics/rqt_multiplot_plugin

Open a new terminal and install the rqt_multiplot:

apt-get install ros-kinetic-rqt -y
apt-get install ros-kinetic-rqt-multiplot -y
apt-get install libqwt-dev -y
rm -rf ~/.config/ros.org/rqt_gui.ini

Run the rqt_plot package node:
rosrun rqt_multiplot rqt_multiplot

Loading a saved configuration file:

The saved config file is saved as ./src/rqt_multiplot.xml. 
When I use --multiplot-config option (check ros_multiplot -h) with rosrun, it seems to search
for config files under /opt/share/kinetic/ros... etc.

Not sure if the support for auto-launching config file is supported completely:

https://github.com/ANYbotics/rqt_multiplot_plugin/issues/12
https://github.com/ANYbotics/rqt_multiplot_plugin/issues/30

https://github.com/ANYbotics/rqt_multiplot_plugin/pull/10

- For the moment, I load the config file from the "open config" option, hit the "play" button
and am able to see Robot's Y vs X position plots.

Another way is to write a launch file for rqt_multiplot, and have all node topics auto-loaded
from there ...
