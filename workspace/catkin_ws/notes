after multiple attempts, the robot finally started moving. It was able to load the controller_manager interfaces, and simple_move issues commands succesfully. (The joints started moving)

-- the only thing I can think of is, I installed the reference simple_arm, compiled it, that started whining (same error), then I went back to the old github code and saw I was getting an error with multiple launch file paths defined. So I built it again (rm devel and build), and *then* after a couple of unsuccessful tries, it just started working. Not sure why. Also just before it started working, I noticed that one of the terminals had a zombie gazebo session and I killed it ....

Here is the one warning I was still getting from roslaunch (but it wasn't about Controller Manager not finding the correct ROS interface) ...

--> repeated and it works now, so will check-in whatever I have now ..

--> oh, and I also basically followed all the steps from the reference simple_arm readme
https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-simple_arm/tree/simple_mover
(notably the rosdep install command installed a few additional packages for me...)


--> btw this below was good reading although I did not use it:
http://catherineh.github.io/programming/2017/10/20/debugging-ros-control


-->>

on my laptop, I did rosdep install -i simple_arm (from the REF pdf file) but got stuck with load_controller waiting (resulting from errors in py__tf2init or something like that) and then I realized my python was still version 3, so downgrading to 2 ..

# added by Miniconda3 4.3.21 installer
#export PATH="/home/anupam/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"

--> so this was how the problem had been addressed. Robotic arms move and work on laptop now too.
