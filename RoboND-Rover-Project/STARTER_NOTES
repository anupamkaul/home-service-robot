To run this when you're looking at like like months from now:

1. ~/.bashrc 'rr' to enable (source activate) a Conda environment for RoboND (sourcing from miniconda3/envs/RoboND)

   (make sure this is done on every terminal being used) ...
   as a check, which python should give /home/anupam/miniconda3/envs/RoboND/bin/python

2. Run simulator : cd roversim; ./Roversim.x64_64 .. choose a good resolution and I have to use Autonomous Mode ... launch.
3. python drive_rover.py - this should connect to the simulator, and the code starts executing, the mars rover starts driving in autonomous mode, collecting rocks, etc.

TO DO:

* Increase probabilty of picking up rocks. (i.e. create conditions such that telenan[near_sample] is more true than not.
* Find a faster way to scan the entire area (right now based on left hugging, but add more optimizations)
* Return back to the starting spot once finished
* Apply more path planning / control logic, or test out an algorithm if possible, given the telemetry data coming from the simulator
* Do not repeat a travelled area (detect if the path has already been travelled)
* Find a way to Map Out the travelling rover so it can be seen on the world map
* Apply RL if possible to improve / optimize the travel
* Apply better steering control and maneuvers / improve the decision states
