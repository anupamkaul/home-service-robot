This does NOT look at pixel values etc and ONLY relies on map sample data for rock.

0. Mark rover_rock (located) as collected or not. 
1. Determine if Rock is Locatable. (same logic as supporting function). 
   Compare a 3m gap with Rover's current Position and make sure Rock has not been collected.
2. Now check current direction, rover location and rover_rock. And take current distance from rock.
3. If rock is "behind" (w.r.t direction) and within acceptable distance (3m?), then stop and turn "enough"
4. If rock is "ahead" (w.r.t direction) then :
   apply steer but reduce it as current distance from rock gets smaller
   apply brake (make sure it works!) and increase it as current distance from rock gets smaller
   make sure brakes are applied and rover is near stationary at about 1 pixel distance
5. In case of (3) remember to re-turn to continue mission in original direction
