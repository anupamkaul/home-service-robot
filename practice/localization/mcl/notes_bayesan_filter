Bayes Filtering

The powerful Monte Carlo localization algorithm estimates the posterior distribution of a robot’s position and orientation based on sensory information. This process is known as a recursive Bayes filter.

Using a Bayes filtering approach, roboticists can estimate the state of a dynamical system from sensor measurements.

In mobile robot localization, it’s important to be acquainted with the following definitions:

Dynamical system: The mobile robot and its environment
State: The robot’s pose, including its position and orientation.
Measurements: Perception data(e.g. laser scanners) and odometry data(e.g. rotary encoders)
The goal of Bayes filtering is to estimate a probability density over the state space conditioned on the measurements. The probability density, or also known as posterior is called the belief and is denoted as:

Bel(X_{t}) = P(X_{t} |Z_{1...t} )Bel(X 
t
​	 )=P(X 
t
​	 ∣Z 
1...t
​	 )

Where,

Xt: State at time t
Z1...t : Measurements from time 1 up to time t

Probability:
Given a set of probabilities, P(A|B) is calculated as follows:

\large P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)*P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B|A)*P(A)}{P(A)*P(B|A) + P(\neg A)*P(B|\neg A)}P(A∣B)= 
P(B)
P(B∣A)∗P(A)
​	 = 
P(A)∗P(B∣A)+P(¬A)∗P(B∣¬A)
P(B∣A)∗P(A)
