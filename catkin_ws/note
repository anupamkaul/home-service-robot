1. when cmaking the simple_arm package, if controller_manager package is not found ..
its a ROS package and can be installed by:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-controller-manager

2. to install rospkg:
sudo apt-get install python-rospk
or:
sudo pip install -U rospkg (I did pip install)

3. pip install defusedxml

4. different gazebo_ros version:

5. A useful site:

NOTE: How to replace gazebo 9 (kinetic) with gazebo 7:
------------------------------------------------------

--> the problem I had was roslaunch was saying resource not found: gazebo_ros
this is because ros-kinetic (ubuntu xenial 16.04) had gazebo v9 (which actually was useful to me because it had the option to specify the PATH for a model to be imported into the robotic simulation world) ..

anyways, when I tried sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros-pkgs

I met unmet dependecies messages.

The *only* way I could get around it, is I picked up 1 thread ... like gazebo7, tried sudo-apt install .. got unmet libgazebo7 ..
tried sudo apt installing that, got unmet libformatsd4 ... tried sudo installing THAT, and THAT worked ! (it stopped whining)

after that I just did sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros-pkgs again and it worked like a charm.
Now I have gazebo 7 instead of gazebo 9.

----------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Robot arm wasnt showing
-----------------------------

A couple of packages like PyQT5 etc were missing, so I pip installed them ..

Also Ros Kinetic needs python 2 and not python 3 (tft error) so I just commented out my anaconda/miniconda python3 in my .bashrc

Finally I had the robotic arm show up with these commands:

1. source devel/setup.bash
2. roslaunch simple-arm(package name) ros_launch_file(whatever that is, I just tabbed)
