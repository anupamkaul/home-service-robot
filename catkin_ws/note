its a ROS package and can be installed by:
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-controller-manager

2. to install rospkg:
sudo apt-get install python-rospk
or:

NOTE: How to replace gazebo 9 (kinetic) with gazebo 7:
------------------------------------------------------

--> the problem I had was roslaunch was saying resource not found: gazebo_ros
this is because ros-kinetic (ubuntu xenial 16.04) had gazebo v9 (which actually was useful to me because it had the option to specify the PATH for a model to be imported into the robotic simulation world) ..

anyways, when I tried sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros-pkgs

I met unmet dependecies messages.

The *only* way I could get around it, is I picked up 1 thread ... like gazebo7, tried sudo-apt install .. got unmet libgazebo7 ..
tried sudo apt installing that, got unmet libformatsd4 ... tried sudo installing THAT, and THAT worked ! (it stopped whining)

after that I just did sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros-pkgs again and it worked like a charm.
Now I have gazebo 7 instead of gazebo 9.
